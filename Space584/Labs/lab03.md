# Lab 3: Tracker

## Due by:

- First Cut at Critical Design Review

- Fully tested tracker due by Flight Readiness Review

## Requirements:

- The team must decide which tracker they would like to build by PDR.

- The team must deliver three operational and fully tested units by FRR.

- All trackers must have a nice case, external indicators for power and GPS lock,
  and a method for powering on that does not require opening the case.

- DO NOT operate any transmitter without radio antenna. (Strongly)
      Consider hot gluing antenna connections (GPS and transmitter) to
      make them more robust. Any antennas should secured in such a way
      that they can not be ripped off.
      
- The GPS antenna should be directed vertically after integration into
  the payload train.

- GPS and battery voltage should be recorded to an SD card to assist
  with debugging.
      
- Test results must demonstrate successful operation of the system
  over the course of at least two hours in the field.

- The team should hide their tracking packages and have other teams
  attempt to find them to demostrate real world operation of the
  tracker.

- Lab should clearly demonstrate this through the use of screenshots
      and/or videos.
