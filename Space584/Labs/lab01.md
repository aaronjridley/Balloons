# Lab 1:  Microcontroller, Sensors, and Data Logging

## Due by:

Critical Design Review

## Requirements

- Microcontroller working with sensors (2xTemperature,
     pressure, humidity, acceleration). The sensors should all be
     polled at close to the same time to show that they are all
     working together.

- Lab should show wiring schematic. 

- Lab should include preliminary calibration of sensors. 

- Include calibration information for sensors, include plots
      of the calibration curves, data used to verify calibration.

- Microcontroller must write data to the data logger.

- Lab should show pictures of breadboard, screenshots of the
      readout of numbers reported from each sensor and plots of sensor
      numbers plotted in MATLAB, python, excel, IDL, etc.

- Lab should show plots of the data over time (2 hours minimum).

- Microcontroller code should be included.
