\begin{enumerate}
  \item From the last lab, you should have a working sketch that can log data
    from all your sensors (except the GPS module) to the OpenLog.
  \item In this lab, you completed a sketch to interfact with the GPS module.
  \item Your next task is to combine these two files into one main sketch that
    can finally handle ALL the sensors on your board and write the data in a
    clean way to your SD card.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item We recommend you copy code FROM the Lab 4 sketch INTO the GPS starter
            code file. This is because the GPS code will be the most fickle and
            error prone code in your final project.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item This portion of the lab is very self directed and we encourage you to
    discuss code design with your team. 
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item A good starting point might be to copy your global variables
            from Lab 4 into your code from this lab
        \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Save a working version of this program for submission with your
    postlab. This is the third and final piece of Arduino code you'll be
  submitting.}
