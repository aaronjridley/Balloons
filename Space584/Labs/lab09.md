# Lab 9:  Camera endurance and cold test

## Due by:

Flight Readiness Review

## Requirements:

- Camera system (2 cameras, orthogonal pointing) working and verified
  to work at $-40^\circ$

- Cameras can take video or high-resolution images every few seconds.

- It is desired that the camera system be contained in one box,
  preferably with a method for turning the system on without having to
  open the box.

- Complete system should be less than 1 lb., desired to be less than
  0.5 lbs.

- Measure battery lifetime prior to cold test, during cold test, after
  cold test, report on performance.  This should be done early in the
  semester, so batteries can be replaced if needed.

- The lab should show that the camera can work for at least 120
  minutes at $-40^\circ$. Some sort of heating system can be used, as
  long as the weight requirements are met.
