# Interface Control Document

## Due by:

March 21st

## Requirements:

- Work with 3-4 ENGR100 teams to design interfaces between
      their ride-share payloads and the payload train.

- These teams will be given requirements with options and they
      will write you a memo describing how they will be attaching to
      the train and how they will meet the requirements.

- You will verify that the design meets the requirement and
      modify if you need to, creating a formal interface control
      document.

- On the Wednesday/Thursday before launch, you should meet
      with the ENGR 100 teams to verify that they have complied with
      the ICD.
