# Lab 2:  Microcontroller + GPS

## Due by:

Critical Design Review

## Requirements:

- Micro-controller working with the GPS, logging the data to the data
      logger. This may be challenging if only using the GPS on the
      tracker. The tracker may have to be modified to log the data, or
      a separate GPS may have to be flown.

- A program on a computer should be able to parse this data and plot
      it in MATLAB, python, excel, IDL, etc.  You can make great
      webpage that displays a google map.

- Include working code in the report.

- Sample data should be shown in the lab write up, along with
      plots of location.

- Lab should show wiring scheme.  

- HINT: Tiny GPS will help prevent memory issues.

- GPS data plotted on Google maps. Clearly label your start
      and end points (use pins).

- Lab should include a map that shows that you can walk or
     drive around campus and get a map in Google that shows your path.
