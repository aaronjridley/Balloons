# Lab 6: PCB designs

## Due by:

Thursday before Spring Break

## Requirements:

- Develop PCB board layout for any system / sub-system that your team
  is working on.

- Lab should show system-level block diagram, schematic, and
      screenshots of PCB with some sort of checklist or data showing
      that the design is what the team actually wanted.

- The PCBs should incorporate all components so that wires are minimized. 

- Nothing that costs more than \$20 should be soldered to the PCB -
      headers/connectors should be mounted to the PCB and the
      components should be put into the headers.

- Battery / Antenna connections should robust enough that the team can
  demonstrate that they will endure the turbulent environment

- All files needed to order PCBs must be reviewed by at least two
      other teams and delivered before class on the Thursday before
      spring break.
